```

### **ArdhaRAG's Predictive Intelligence**
```
Conversation Context → Markov Prediction → Anticipatory Retrieval → Proactive Context Assembly
         ↑                    ↓                       ↓                        ↓
[CONTINUOUS ANALYSIS]  [PREDICT NEXT NEEDS]  [PRELOAD INFORMATION]  [INTELLIGENT RESPONSE]
                                     ↓
                         Cross-Domain Intelligence + Temporal Patterns
